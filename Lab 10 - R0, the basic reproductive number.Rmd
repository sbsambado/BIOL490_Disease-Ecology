Anderson and May's concept of a basic reproductive numner, R0
- R0 is unitless, not a rate
- R0: the average number of secondary infections that occur when one infective individual is exposed to an entirely susceptible host population
- R0, reproductive rate in population ecology, represents the growth rate ofa population
- R0 > 1, population is growing
- R0 < 1, population is declining

Assumptions of R0
- population is wholly susceptible with no immunity
- population is well-mixed in a homogeneous ways (no sub-networks)
R0 = 1, disease is at an endemic steady state

Estimating R0 can be done empirically or theoretically. Disease incidence data can be used to calculate R0.

R0 can be estimated as the transmission rate over the recovery rate
